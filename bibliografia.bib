  abstract = {An important problem in reliability is to define and estimate the
	optimal burn-in time. For bathtub shaped failure-rate lifetime distributions,
	the optimal burn-in time is frequently defined as the point where
	the corresponding mean residual life function achieves its maximum.
	For this point, we construct an empirical estimator and develop the
	corresponding statistical inferential theory. Theoretical results
	are accompanied with simulation studies and applications to real
	data. Furthermore, we develop a statistical inferential theory for
	the difference between the minimum point of the corresponding failure
	rate function and the aforementioned maximum point of the mean residual
	life function. The difference measures the length of the time interval
	after the optimal burn-in time during which the failure rate function
	continues to decrease and thus the burn-in process can be stopped.},
